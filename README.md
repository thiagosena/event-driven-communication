## ðŸ’» Project

Spring Cloud Stream is a framework that is part of the Spring Cloud ecosystem. It is possible to develop
event-driven applications and Stream applications, which communicate in real time and asynchronously using messaging.

It abstracts the use of a message broker, making it possible to port our source code and all business rules to a
different message broker, without having to change it.

## âœ¨ Technologies

- [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot): Makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring
  based Applications that you can "just run".
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com): is an open-source message-broker software that originally implemented the
  Advanced Message Queuing Protocol and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text
  Oriented Messaging Protocol, MQ Telemetry Transport, and other protocols.
- [Spring Cloud Stream](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream): Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building
  highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com): is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
